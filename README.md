Optional: A JavaScript date library or native JavaScript Date object for timestamp formatting

Features

User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
Thought Sharing: Users can create and share their thoughts with their friends.
Reaction System: Users can react to their friends' thoughts with likes or other reactions.
Friend Management: Users can add or remove friends from their friend list.
Timestamp Formatting: Optional implementation for clear and readable timestamps.
